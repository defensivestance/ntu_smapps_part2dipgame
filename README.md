# NTU-SMAPPS Part 2 Game Public

This game takes inspiration from **Crosy Road** to create an engaging game to spread awareness of drugs & vapes in hopes to prevent its usage. The game is part of a section of the overarching project to tackle the problem statement. It is built using ![Unity](https://unity.com/).

> Note: Leaderboard does not work to prevent Firebase/Unity API Keys to be misused.
>       Missing scripts in regards to leaderboard.

For additional details on the game, the Unity game packages can be found in the repository.
